      Welcome to the INFORMED CONSENT page.
      <br><br>
      This consent form describes the research study and helps you decide if you want to participate. We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from Washington University in St. Louis.
      <br><br>
      If you agree to participate, we would like you to participate in a two-player word game that you will play with another player, and also participate in a vocabulary test and demographics questionnaire. The entire task should not exceed 60-75 minutes. You are free to skip any questions that you prefer not to answer on the questionnaires.
      <br><br>
      Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You can close this browser window if you do not wish to participate.
