     Welcome to Connector! You will be playing a word game with another player. You are the GUESSER in this game, while the other player is the SPEAKER. You and the Speaker will both be looking at the same 20-item word board on a given trial and try to collectively identify certain words on the board.
      <br><br>
      Within a trial, as the Guesser, you will be presented with a one-word clue which the Speaker has generated, and your task is to select the two words that the Speaker most likely intended to refer to, based on this clue. The Speaker has been instructed to choose one-word clues that are related to both words in meaning.
      <br><br>
      To appropriately understand your search process, we also want you to make note of all possible words you are considering during a given trial by simply clicking on the words on the board. After selecting these “candidates”, you can then select your final guesses from these candidates. After each step, please click “Done”.
      <br><br>
      For any word pair, you will have 3 attempts to choose the correct words on the board, after which the experiment will move on to the next word pair. You will be guessing 3 word pairs per board, and 10 boards in total.
      <br><br>
      We will now have a practice session so that you are familiar with the game procedures. Click “Done” to continue.
