      Welcome to Connector! You will be playing a word game with another player. You are the SPEAKER in
      this game, while the other player is the GUESSER. You and the Guesser will both be looking at the same
      20-item word board on a given trial and try to collectively identify certain words on the board.
      <br><br>
      Within a trial, as the Speaker, you will be presented with two words from the board. Your task as the Speaker is to select any <strong>one-word clue</strong> for the two words. Please try your best to select clues that are related to <strong>both</strong> words and are not words on the board. For example, for the word-pair, “APPLE-MANGO”, FRUIT is a good clue because it is related to both APPLE and MANGO, whereas RED is a bad clue because it is only related to APPLE. Please ensure that you are always selecting one-word clues, and clues that are related to the words in <strong>meaning</strong>. Clues that give away the sound or letters of the words are not good clues. For example, for the word pair “CAT-BAT”, RHYME is not a good clue because it tells the Guesser to look for sound-related information instead of meaning-related information.
      <br><br>
      Finally, to appropriately understand your search process, we also want you to make note of all possible clues you are considering during a given trial. You can fill these “candidates” into the text boxes and you can then select your final clue from these candidates. After each step, please click “Done”.
      <br><br>
      For any word pair, you will have 3 attempts to make the Guesser choose the correct words on the board, after which the experiment will move on to the next word pair. You will be given 3 word pairs per board, and 10 boards in total.
      <br><br>
      We will now have a practice session so that you are familiar with the game procedures. Click “Done” to continue.
