      Welcome to Connector! You will be playing a word game with another player. You are the GUESSER in
      this game, while the other player is the SPEAKER. You and the Speaker will both be looking at the <b>same</b>
      20-item word board on a given trial and try to collectively identify certain words on the board.
      <br><br>
      Within a trial, as the Guesser, you will be presented with a one-word clue which the Speaker has
      generated, and your task is to select the two words that the Speaker most likely intended to refer to,
      based on this clue. The Speaker has been instructed to choose one clue each round, that is related to both
      words in meaning. For example, if the Speaker was given the word-pair “APPLE-MANGO”, they may
      come up with the clue “FRUIT”, which would be provided to you. There may be multiple words on the
      board that are related to the word “FRUIT”, in which case you should select the two words you think the
      Speaker intended to refer to with this particular clue.
      <br><br>
      An important aspect of this research study is to understand your search process more clearly. Therefore,
      we would like you to make note of all possible words you are considering during a given trial by simply
      clicking on the words on the board, as soon as they come to mind. After selecting these “candidates”, you
      should click “Done”. Then, you can then select your final two guesses from these candidates.
      <br><br>
      For any word pair, you will have 3 attempts to choose the correct words on the board, after which the
      experiment will move on to the next word pair. You will be guessing 3 word pairs per board, and 10
      boards in total.
      <br><br>
      We will now have a practice session so that you are familiar with the game procedures. Click “Done” to continue.
