      Welcome to Connector! You will be playing a word game with another player. You are the SPEAKER in
      this game, while the other player is the GUESSER. You and the Guesser will both be looking at the <b>same</b>
      20-item word board on a given trial and try to collectively identify certain words on the board.
      <br><br>
      Within a trial, as the Speaker, you will be presented with two words from the board. Your task as the
      Speaker is to select any <b>one-word clue</b> for the two words and input that clue in the provided
      textbox as will be seen on the page. Please try your best to select clues that are
      related to <b>both</b> words and are not words on the board. IF the clue entered is on the board then it will 
      show that it is forbidden. For example, for the word-pair, “APPLE-MANGO”,
      FRUIT is a good clue because it is related to both APPLE and MANGO, whereas RED is a bad clue
      because it is only related to APPLE. Please ensure that you are always selecting one-word clues, and
      clues that are related to the words in <b>meaning</b>. Clues that give away the sound or letters of the words are
      not good clues. For example, for the word pair “CAT-BAT”, RHYME is not a good clue because it tells the
      Guesser to look for sound-related information instead of meaning-related information.
      <br><br>
      <!-- An important aspect of this research study is to understand your search process more clearly. Therefore,
      we would like you to make note of all possible words that come to mind for a given word pair. It is
      possible that you might come up with a good clue immediately, but we would like you to make note of <b>all</b>
      words that come to mind as soon as they come to mind. You can type in these “candidates” into the text
      boxes provided below the board (pressing tab each time you move from one candidate to another) and
      you can then select your final clue from these candidates. After each step, please click “Done”.
       -->
      <br><br>
      For any word pair, you will be able to type in one clue for each word pair and
      you will have 3 attempts to make the Guesser choose the correct words on the board,
      after which the experiment will move on to the next word pair. You will be given 3 word pairs per board,
      and 10 boards in total.
      <br><br>
      We will now have a practice session so that you are familiar with the game procedures. Click “Done” to continue.
