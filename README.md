code for reproducing analyses in our paper ["Contextual Flexibility Guides Communication in a Cooperative Language Game"](https://rxdhawkins.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/cogsci21a-sub1142-cam-i9.pdf)

# Instructions

Our analyses use a combination of Jupyter notebooks (for deriving model predictions) and R notebooks (for visualization and statistical analysis).

There are two ways of running our python code:

* **Colab**: The easiest way to reproduce our model results is by using this self-contained [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-golo6imFfE01Uv9qw7ArORyzCNDHAT8#scrollTo=GsOHknjeXUoo). The notebook will prompt you for Google account authentication but should otherwise run in the browser the same as it would on your local machine.

* **Locally**: To run the jupyter notebooks on your local machine, first [download the data as a zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12xJxgIp2IqMA3xB5iBAYurV8gO11V54Y/view?usp=sharing), unpack it in the `./data/` directory, and then run `jupyter lab`.

To run the R Notebook, follow [these instructions](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to download and open the RStudio IDE.
