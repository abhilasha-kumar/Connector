## Description

A project in collaboration with Kumar Abhilasha (abhilasha.kumar@wustl.edu) and the Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute (https://www.diverseintelligencessummer.com/).
This is the game file that implements the nodeGame framework to run online multiplayer experiments. This experiment involves two player, a guesser and a clue-giver. The goal of the clue-giver is to give a single word clue that allows the guesser to select two pre-selected words from a list that both players have acess to. The players take turns guessing and giving clues untill the guesser guesses correctly or they guess incorrectly three times. The players repeat this process for ten boards, guessing three word pairs for each board (with one additional board for practice).
At each stage of the experiment the participants list the options that they considered in chronological order. This allows us to compare the times they spent searching for words to help model the search space. See Kumar_Connector.pdf for full details.
